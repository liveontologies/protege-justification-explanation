The Live Ontologies Project team is pleased to announce 
        the Protege Justification Explanation 0.1.1 release!

A plug-in for the Protégé Desktop ontology editor that adds an explanation service for
displaying minimal subset of axioms (justifications) for entailments. Compared to the
explanation-workbench plug-in bundled with Protégé, this plug-in can use multiple
providers for computing justifications. Each of these providers should be a plug-in
that implements the new extension points (see plugin.xml).
