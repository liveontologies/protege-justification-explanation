The Live Ontologies Project team is pleased to announce 
        the Protege Justification Explanation 0.0.1 release!

A plug-in for the Protégé Desktop ontology editor that adds an explanation service for
displaying minimal subset of axioms (justifications) for entailments. Compared to the
explanation-workbench plug-in bundled with Protégé, this plug-in can use multiple
providers for computing justifications. Each of these providers should be a plug-in
that implements the new extension points (see plugin.xml).

Changes in this version:
------------------------
New features:
- Initial implementation based on explanation-workbench. 
- Use third party justification computation services over extension points. 
- Provide settings that can be changed from explanation preferences. 
Fixed Bugs:
- Fix disposing compoments when the explanation window is closed.  Issue: 7. 
- Display justifications for entailments which appear as axioms in the ontology.  Issue: 5. 
Changes:
- Make sure preferences persist over Protege restart. 
- Do not show all computed justifications, but load them using a button. 
- Sort only displayed justifications using a priority queue. 
- Cache information about occurrences of axioms in jutifications. 
- Cache wether axioms are asserted (appear in ontologies) or derived.  Issue: 13. 
- Improve comparison of justifications by caching the necessary information, such as sizes. 
- Display information about axiom occurrences only in tooltips. 
- Do not count axioms in justifications, show only justification sizes. 
- Tell that the entailment is a tautology if its justificaiton is empty.  Issue: 4. 
- Allow justification service to provide initial justifications (e.g., if they have been cached). 


Have fun!
