The Live Ontologies Project team is pleased to announce 
        the Protege Justification Explanation 0.1.1 release!

A plug-in for the [Protégé Desktop](https://protege.stanford.edu) ontology 
editor that adds an explanation service for displaying minimal subset of 
axioms (justifications) for entailments. Compared to the 
[explanation-workbench](https://github.com/protegeproject/explanation-workbench)
plug-in bundled with Protégé, this plug-in can use custom services for computing
justifications.
